## - pokemon icons taken from <https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites/tree/master>

The tasks has been implemented in the following requirements:

1. Create a conteiner for pokemon and style it.
2. Make an API call for a given endpoint and fetch the list of pokemons "<https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/>"
3. Display the list of pokemons

Challeneges that I had during the implementation:

- Unfamiliar documantion pokeapi.co
- No icon rsc, took initiation to find a solution (used open src git repository).

Feedback:

- it was fun and exciting experiance to do got to know that there exist almost 2gb of pokemons icons :)
